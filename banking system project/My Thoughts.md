#	My Thoughts After Doing The Banking System Project

###	What I Learned:
1.	Making projects is super fun (literally)
2.	I establishes OOP concepts so will and felt why its the best way to write a code
3.	Practiced on operator overloadin, file handling, maps, ect...
4.	Code could be always better than what it's but at some point you gotta let it go.
5.	The point that you should stop working on your project "espicially for learning sake" is when you are not doing\learning anything new.

###	what This Project Makes Me Wants to Learn:
1.	How to make a GUI program.
2.	Dive deeply into C++ language and master it with its all related concepts (OOP, data structure, algorithms, etc...)
