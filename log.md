# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 06, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I started a banking system project which is from the course that i've recently finished (& the only course), made a flow chart for the project, and made the code structure (classes & functions declaration ...) .

**Thoughts:** I guess it will not be an easy one as its my first time making a project but i'll keep going.

### Day 2: August 07, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Improved the code structure, considered adding some new features and a way to implement them and I wrote some functions definition.

**Thoughts:** I feel like i'm going very slow but as long as i'm learning and making new steps its fine.

### Day 3: August 08, 2020

**Today's Progress:** implemented every member function of the project classes, finalized the program structure and practiced a bit on file handling using C++.

**Thoughts:** feeling so much Improvement which makes me so excited.

### Day 4: August 09, 2020

**Today's Progress:** put the final touches on my projects and its now ready to run -> implemented my new defined exceptions, reviewed the pretyped functions and commented them, and completed the main function.

**Thoughts:** i've learned so much doing this project but there is still to much to go. [My Thoughts About The Project](https://github.com/MaGnsio/100-days-of-code/blob/master/banking%20system%20project/My%20Thoughts.md)

### Day 5: August 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** today i started practicing on problems (codeforces mainly) and i solved 5 easy problems.

**Thoughts:** solving problems and cp is so much fun and make you feel like you are doing some kind of esports (and you are) however its require so much concentration and a lot of practice.

### Day 6: August 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** continued practicing on problem solving (on code forces) and tried to be prepared as much as possible for tommorow's code forces div2 round.

**Thoughts:** NULL.

### Day 7: August 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** participated in "Codeforces Round #664 (Div. 2)" got the 9985 rank (solved 0) (close to 2), reviewed some of the contest problems solutions, and solved like 3 other problems from code forces problemset.

**Thoughts:** despite solving 0 problems and getting low rank i'm not disappointed at all as i didn't have high expectations. after seeing that my rating got increased by 370 it felt like i'm doing well.

### Day 8: August 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** solved problems on code forces, searched for some cp tips and tried to get more into data structures and algorithms.
