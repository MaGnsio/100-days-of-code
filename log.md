# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 06, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I started a banking system project which is the for the last course i've finished (& the only), made a flow chart for the project, made the code structure.

**Thoughts:** I guess it will not be an easy one as its my first time making a project but i'll keep going.
