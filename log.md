# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 06, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I started a banking system project which is from the course that i've recently finished (& the only course), made a flow chart for the project, and made the code structure (classes & functions declaration ...) .

**Thoughts:** I guess it will not be an easy one as its my first time making a project but i'll keep going.

### Day 1: August 07, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Improved the code structure, considered adding some new features and a way to implement them and I wrote some functions definition.

**Thoughts:** I feel like i'm going very slow but as long as i'm learning and making new steps its fine.
