# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 06, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I started a banking system project which is from the course that i've recently finished (& the only course), made a flow chart for the project, and made the code structure (classes & functions declaration ...) .

**Thoughts:** I guess it will not be an easy one as its my first time making a project but i'll keep going.
